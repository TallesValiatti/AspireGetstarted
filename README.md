This repo is about .NET Aspire, a platform launched with .NET 8 that provides cloud-optimized, distributed, observable, and production-ready applications through a set of NuGet packages addressing specific cloud concerns.

Cloud-native applications typically consist of interconnected microservices rather than a single monolithic codebase and often utilize services such as databases, messaging, and caching.

To explore the functionalities of .NET Aspire, this repo will guide you through the creation of an application, demonstrating how to leverage this platform for building modern, scalable cloud-native solutions.
